Commands to get rocksteady up and running.  Assuming debian

Check out code

`svn checkout http://rocksteady.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rocksteady-read-only`

Install java

`sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre rabbitmq mysql-server`

Install maven with apt-get

`sudo apt-get install maven2`

The maven version on debian repo might be too old, if that's the case, [http://maven.apache.org/download.html download maven] tar ball, untar it somewhere, and set a command alias of mvn to the newly downloaded maven binary.

Enter the directory

`cd rocksteady-read-only`

Run this command to download all rocksteady's Jar dependencies.  Jar is like a tar ball for java to distribute compile binary.

`mvn package`

If anything failed to download, create an "issue" here for others to troubleshoot.

If everything looks good, there will be a new directory called "target" which all the compiled code and library sit in.
