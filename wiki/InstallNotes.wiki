Commands to get rocksteady up and running.  Assuming debian

===Check out code===

*`svn checkout http://rocksteady.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rocksteady-read-only`*

===Dependecies===

*`sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre mysql-server-5.0 rabbitmq-server`*

Install maven with apt-get ( If you want to build from source )

*`sudo apt-get install maven2`*

`*`_The maven version on debian repo might be too old, if that's the case, [http://maven.apache.org/download.html download maven] tar ball, untar it somewhere, and set a command alias of mvn to the newly downloaded maven binary._

*`alias mvn=$HOME/apache-maven/bin/mvn`*

Enter the code directory

*`cd rocksteady-read-only`*

Setup SQL table and create rocksteady user and privilege

*`sudo mysql < setup.sql`*

===Source Build===
Run this command to download all rocksteady's Jar dependencies.  Jar is like a tar ball for java to distribute compile binary.

*`mvn package`*

If anything failed to download, create an "issue" here for others to troubleshoot.

If everything looks good, there will be a new directory called "target" which all the compiled code and library sit in.

*`cd target`*

Run dev mode

*`../run_dev`*

run_dev invokes "mvn compile" then starts rocksteady in dev mode with more verbose log.
